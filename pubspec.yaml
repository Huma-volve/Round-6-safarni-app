  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:

    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/


    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/icons/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package


     - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg



  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:

        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 800
    # - family: Trajan Pro
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf


        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf

         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf

  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf

  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
